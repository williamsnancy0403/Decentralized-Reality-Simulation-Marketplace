// Deploy the universe
const universe = await platform.createUniverse(universeConfig);
console.log(`Universe created with ID: ${universe.id}`);
```

### Licensing a Simulation Experience

```javascript
// Configure license terms for a universe
const licenseConfiguration = await universe.configureLicensing({
